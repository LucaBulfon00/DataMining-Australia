# DataMining-Australia
This project will attempt to analyze multiple measurements of different meteorological parameters (temperature, wind, humidity, pressureâ€¦) during a day and predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not. The project will use data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) contained inside a dataset available on Kaggle.com.
